## Critical Issues & Blockers

### 1. Cache Persistence Architecture (**High Priority**)

**Problem**: ccache not populating across build steps despite successful copy operations
- Zig cache: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- ccache: ‚ùå Files copied but cache not effective

**Current Investigation**:
- Cache directory permissions and ownership
- ccache configuration and environment variables
- VM filesystem mount behavior
- Cache invalidation patterns

**Proposed Solution**: Implement NFS-based shared cache system
- 1-2 dedicated storage hosts with 2TB capacity
- Shared cache directory mounted across all build hosts
- Eliminates upload/download latency for cache artifacts

### 2. Test Environment Stability (**High Priority**)

**Problem**: 4 persistent test failures on main branch
- Root cause: Environment variable configuration issues
- Impact: Cannot achieve 100% test pass rate required for production

**Investigation Required**:
- Environment variable inheritance in Tart VMs
- Path resolution differences between host and VM
- Service discovery and networking configuration

### 3. Main Branch Integration (**High Priority**)

**Problem**: Development branch diverging from main
- Need to merge latest main branch changes
- Potential conflicts with CI infrastructure changes
- Risk of introducing regressions

**Required Actions**:
- Merge main branch into feature branch
- Resolve any CI configuration conflicts
- Validate all tests pass with latest main

## Blue/Green Deployment Strategy

### Current Plan
1. **Blue Environment**: Existing MacStadium/cloud infrastructure
2. **Green Environment**: New on-premises macOS CI infrastructure

### Migration Strategy

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Cache system performance below targets | Medium | High | NFS implementation, fallback to current system |
| Test failures cannot be resolved | Low | High | Environment isolation improvements, upstream fixes |
| Main branch merge conflicts | Medium | Medium | Regular merging, careful conflict resolution |
| Blue/green deployment issues | Low | High | Gradual rollout, comprehensive testing, quick rollback |
| Hardware procurement delays | Medium | Low | Continue development on existing hardware |

- **Documentation coverage**: 100% operational procedures documented

## Cost Analysis

### Current State (Cloud-based)
- MacStadium: ~$1,000/month
- EC2 instances: ~$500/month
- **Total**: ~$1,500/month

### Target State (On-premises)
- Hardware amortization: ~$100/month
- Power and internet: ~$150/month
- Monitoring services: ~$50/month
- **Total**: ~$300/month
- **Net Savings**: ~$1,200/month (~$14,400/year)

## Conclusion

The macOS CI infrastructure project has achieved significant milestones in automation and operational capabilities. With focused effort on cache optimization and test stability, production deployment is achievable within 2-3 weeks using a blue/green strategy to minimize risk.

The system demonstrates strong potential for cost savings ($14,400/year) while providing improved build performance and operational control. Key remaining work involves resolving technical blockers and implementing the gradual migration strategy.
