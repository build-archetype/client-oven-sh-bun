# Self-hosted CI for Bun.sh builds (macOS Focus)

This CI system is designed for Bun.sh builds, with a focus on macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) using Tart VMs for full isolation. It can be extended to Linux and Windows, but by default only macOS jobs are enabled.

## Usage -- Quick Start

1. **Clone and run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/build-archetype/client-oven-sh-bun/feat/sam/on-prem-mac-ci/infrastructure/setup/setup-mac-server.sh
   chmod +x setup-mac-server.sh
   ./setup-mac-server.sh
   ```

2. **GitHub Token Setup:**
   - You must create a GitHub token (classic or fine-grained) with at least `repo:status` (for public repos) or additional permissions for private repos.
   - Add this token as a secret in your Buildkite pipeline settings (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

3. **Manual Bootstrap Script Setup in Buildkite:**
   - In Buildkite, go to your pipeline settings.
   - Click "Pipeline Steps" and select "YAML Steps".
   - Paste the following as your initial step:
     ```yaml
     steps:
       - label: ":rocket: Bootstrap CI Pipeline"
         command: "node .buildkite/ci.mjs"
         agents:
           queue: "darwin"
     ```
   - This will generate and upload the full dynamic pipeline for your build.

4. **Agent Configuration:**
   - The setup script configures your agent with:
     ```
     tags="os=macos,arch=aarch64,queue=darwin"
     ```
   - All macOS build and test jobs will use the `darwin` queue. Make sure your agent is running and registered with this queue.

## Build Pipeline Overview

- **Supported Platforms:**
  - macOS (Apple Silicon/arm64 and Intel/x64) — enabled by default
  - Linux and Windows — present in config, but commented out (uncomment to enable)
- **VM Isolation:**
  - All macOS builds and tests run inside fresh Tart VMs for full isolation and reproducibility.
- **Dynamic Pipeline:**
  - The pipeline is generated by `.buildkite/ci.mjs` and uploaded by the bootstrap step.
  - Only macOS jobs will run unless you uncomment other platforms in the config.

## Pipeline Steps

1. **VM Preparation**
   - Cleans up old VMs and creates fresh ones for each job.
2. **Build Dependencies**
   - Uses smart caching for dependencies.
3. **Build Matrix**
   - Builds for each enabled macOS architecture (M1/M2/M3/Intel).
4. **Test Matrix**
   - Runs tests in parallel across architectures, each in a clean VM.
5. **Performance Analysis & Artifact Management**
   - Benchmarks, artifact caching, and cleanup.

## Agent Configuration

Agents are tagged as follows:
```yaml
tags: "os=macos,arch=aarch64,queue=darwin"
```
- Only one queue per agent is supported in Buildkite clusters.
- If you want to support both arm64 and x64, run separate agents with the appropriate `arch` tag.

## GitHub Token Setup

- **Create a GitHub token** (classic or fine-grained) with at least `repo:status` (public) or additional permissions for private repos.
- **Add the token as a secret** in your Buildkite pipeline settings (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- This is required for status updates and some pipeline steps.

## Manual Bootstrap Script Setup in Buildkite

1. Go to your pipeline settings in Buildkite.
2. Click "Pipeline Steps" and select "YAML Steps".
3. Paste the following as your initial step:
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - label: ":rocket: Bootstrap CI Pipeline"
       command: "node .buildkite/ci.mjs"
       agents:
         queue: "darwin"
   ```
4. Save and run the pipeline. This will generate and upload the full dynamic pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

- **Job stuck on "Waiting for agent":**
  - Make sure your agent is running and registered with `queue=darwin` and the correct `arch` tag.
  - Only one queue per agent is allowed in Buildkite clusters.
  - Check agent status with `buildkite-agent status`.
- **GitHub token errors:**
  - Ensure your token is set as a secret in Buildkite and has the required permissions.
- **To enable Linux/Windows jobs:**
  - Uncomment the relevant platforms in `.buildkite/ci.mjs` in the `buildPlatforms` and `testPlatforms` arrays.

## Maintenance and Updates

- To update or reconfigure, simply re-run `setup-mac-server.sh`.
- For diagnostics, use `health-check.sh`.
- For VM refresh, re-run the setup script or use Tart commands as needed.
